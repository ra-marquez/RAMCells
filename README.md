# RAMCells
A library of all the custom electrochemical cell designs I created during my PhD research. 

3D Models are organized by publications. Each folder also may include additional resources, such as videos or schemes relevant for the design. 

For questions and more details about the designs, don't hesitate to contact me at raul.marquez@utexas.edu

Have fun!
